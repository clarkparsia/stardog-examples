# README

This demo illustrates the use of the Spark Connector to some some graph analytics algorithms against data queried from Stardog. In this demo, you will learn:

1. How to create different reasoning schemas in Stardog
2. How to run a graph algorithm from the command line with the selected schema
3. Why the default query should not be used
4. How to run GraphAnalytics from the Spark Connector in a Databricks notebook, or as a Databricks Job.

Complete instructions are found in the [Stardog documentation](https://docs.stardog.com/graph-analytics/setup).
